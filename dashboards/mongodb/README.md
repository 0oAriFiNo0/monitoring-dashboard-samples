### Dashboards for MongoDB

### Notes

- The deprecated dashboard listed [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/monitoring-dashboard-samples/tree/master/dashboards/mongodb/deprecated) exists as an alternative for people who deployed their mongo instance within GCE, however the more external installation seems the more prevalent, so that is the default.

|Filename: [mongodb-gce-overview.json](mongodb-gce-overview.json)|
|This dashboard has several charts for the related [Google Cloud Ops Agent Integration for MongoDB](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ops-agent/tree/master/docs/mongodb.md), including metrics like `Active Connections`, `Collection Size`, `Server Memory Usage`, `Index Count`, `Index Size`, and `Operations`.|
