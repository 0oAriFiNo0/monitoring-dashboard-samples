# MySQL Alerts for GKE

## Connection errors alert
Connection errors mean a connection failed to be established. This indicates applications may be having trouble connecting to your MySQL database. See the `error` label on the time-series that triggers the alert for a more specific cause.


### Creating Notification Channels and User Labels

It is strongly recommended to add notification channels and user labels to the alert policies. The notification channel will set the notification destination if the alert policy is triggered. User labels are used for categorization, and can be used to indicate the severity level.

### User Labels

Supplying user labels could give extra identification information about the firing alert:

i.e.

```json
    "userLabels": {
        "Severity": "Warning"
    }
```

### Notification Channels

The ID of the notification channel to be notified.

```json
    "notificationChannels": [
        "projects/project-id/notificationChannels/1234567"
    ]
```
