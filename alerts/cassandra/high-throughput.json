        "content": "This Alert generally is looking at unexpected increases of throughput in the Cassandra requests. The threshold will be mostly determined based off normalcy of the environment the node is in, but the alert is defaulted to 20000 writes-per-second. Feel free to adjust threshold to fit your environment. It is generally good to keep an eye on the number of write requests going into detect any anomalies in either lack of writes or overbearance of rights.\n",
