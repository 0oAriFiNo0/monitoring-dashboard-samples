    "content": "The request rate is derived from the requests metrics taken as a rate every 5 minutes. This value should be monitored beforehand to understand what qualifies as a normal request rate so a threshold can be established. When request rate is above this threshold, then that means there is a large spike in traffic which logs can help diagnose if these are nefarious requests.",
