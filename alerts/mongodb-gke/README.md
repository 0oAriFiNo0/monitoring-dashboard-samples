# Alerts for MongoDB in GKE

## Connections near max alert

If connections are approaching the limit, then new connections cannot be established. By default the mongod rejects connections at around 52000. Applications may stop functioning if connections cannot be established.

### Creating Notification Channels and User Labels

It is strongly recommended to add notification channels and user labels to the alert policies. The notification channel will set the notification destination if the alert policy is triggered. User labels are used for categorization, and can be used to indicate the severity level.

### User Labels

Supplying user labels could give extra identification information about the firing alert:

i.e.

```json
    "userLabels": {
        "Severity": "Warning"
    }
```

### Notification Channels

The ID of the notification channel to be notified.

```json
    "notificationChannels": [
        "projects/project-id/notificationChannels/1234567"
    ]
```
